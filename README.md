# CONFIG

A collection of little configuration files for external tools we like to use. It includes:

- `issue` from `/etc/`, because presentation matters.

- My `bashrc`, because of course it's here.

- `kbdrate.service` from `/etc/systemd/system/` -- most of my time is spent typing and some 20 years of muscle memory fail me completely if this bit is too far off from what I'm used to.

- `radeon.conf` and `amdgpu.conf` from `/etc/modprobe.d/` so I can use my brother's GPU.

- A reminder that I need [this](https://github.com/rabits/esi-maya22-linux) to use my soundcard.

- `dwm` header.

- `urxvt` extensions.

- `lycon.map`, which is my keymap, together with `vconsole.conf` from `/etc/`

- `X11` user settings, together with `xlycon` for the keymap.


- `bin` containing miscellaneous utilities:

  - `rt` mini-module for displaying CPU/GPU temperatures on the desktop bar.

  - `new-repo`, which is just nice to have.

  - `ywman` for calling `yt-dlp` without the hussle of dealing with `yt-dlp`.

  - `anwall` for placing videos as desktop background.

  - `mkv2mp4` to have `ffmpeg` do it's thing.

  - `winex`, a little template for running __absolutely proprietary__ software. A sad thing to do, but sometimes there's no other choice.
